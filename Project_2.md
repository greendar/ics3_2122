# Project 2 #

Create a library that has a function called **product** that will read a file called **numbers.txt**, multiply the numbers and return their product.

There will be three numbers.

Example file:
```
2
4
3
```
Correct Output
```
24
```

## BONUS ##
Create your function so that if there is an unknown quantity of numbers in the file it will still return the correct product.

The program I will use to check your answer is

```Python
from greenProj2 import products

product('numbers.txt') # three numbers

product('numbers2.txt') # unknown number of numbers
```

### Included Files ###
numbers.txt

numbers2.txt
